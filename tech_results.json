So, this ensures both metrics are on comparable scale without altering their distribution. After the standardization, I would calculate the correlation coefficient to understand the strength and direction of their relationship. So, this approach ensures meaningful unbiased insight despite different units.",

        "answer": "The proper handling of asynchronous operations and prevent raised conditions on unexpected behavior I would use the following strategies. First is to use asynchronous consistently to write readable and predicted asynchronous code and error handling with try catch blocks. Second is to cancel outdated requests. Third is to re-bow or throttle user actions. Third is to track request order. Fifth is to use state flags. Sixth is to leverage the assing utilities. Seven is to test edge cases. So these strategies will be helping me to maintain data consistency, improve user experience, and ensure robust asynchronous workflow.",
